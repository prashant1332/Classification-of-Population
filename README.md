# Description
The Classification of Population using Clustering Algorithm project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to group individuals in a population into distinct clusters based on their shared characteristics. The primary objective is to identify natural patterns and similarities within the population data, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying structure.  To achieve this, relevant features are selected, encompassing demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral aspects. These features include age, income, education, occupation, marital status, geographic location, family size, spending habits, interests/hobbies, and social behavior. Each feature contributes to defining the unique characteristics of individuals in the population.  The project involves the utilization of clustering algorithms to perform the classification task. Common clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, are considered. These algorithms group individuals together based on the similarity of their feature values, creating clusters that represent distinct segments within the population.

# Features
The project will use a set of relevant features that can effectively characterize individuals in the population. The features may include:

<b>Age:</b> The age of individuals, which can be a crucial demographic factor.

<b>Income:</b> The income level or earning capacity of individuals.

<b>Education:</b> The highest educational qualification attained by individuals.

<b>Occupation:</b> The type of occupation or employment status of individuals.

<b>Marital Status:</b> The marital status of individuals (e.g., married, single, divorced).

<b>Geographic Location:</b> The geographical location or region where individuals reside.

<b>Family Size:</b> The number of members in the individual's household.

<b>Spending Habits:</b> Information about individuals' spending behavior or consumption patterns.

<b>Interests/Hobbies:</b> The interests or hobbies of individuals, indicating their preferences and lifestyle.

<b>Social Behavior:</b> Data related to individuals' social interactions or engagement on various platforms.
